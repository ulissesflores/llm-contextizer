abstract: >
  Zero-dependency CLI that generates an LLM-optimized text context from a codebase
  by emitting an ASCII directory tree followed by concatenated file contents, with
  sensible defaults for noise filtering, truncation of log-like files, and output
  self-inclusion safety when redirecting stdout.
